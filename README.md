# Cointab

A Table displaying cryptocurrency prices from the Coinlore API - BuyCoins UI Developer Coding Challenge (Starter). Uses Gulp 4.x.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

_**Note:** if you've previously installed Gulp globally, run `npm rm --global gulp` to remove it. [Details here.](https://medium.com/gulpjs/gulp-sips-command-line-interface-e53411d4467)_

Make sure these are installed first.

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
- [Gulp Command Line Utility](http://gulpjs.com) `npm install --global gulp-cli`

### Quick Start

1. In bash/terminal/command line, `cd` into your project directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install required files and dependencies.
3. When it's done installing, run one of the task runners to get going:
   - `gulp` manually compiles files.
   - `gulp watch` automatically compiles files and applies changes using [BrowserSync](https://browsersync.io/) when you make changes to your source files.

**Try it out.** After installing, run `gulp` to compile some test files into the `dist` directory. Or, run `gulp watch` and make some changes to see them recompile automatically.
